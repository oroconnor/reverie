title:  Kingston Home Sales Trends

Here where I live in Kingston, NY, there is a sense right now that homes are being bought up rather quickly as people in New York City are realizing that a population density of 26,403 per sq. mile isn't as fun during a pandemic.[1] 

You'll hear anecdotes from people looking for a first home of having their offers beaten by quick and high cash offers from New York City buyers. You don't need a dataset to get the general feeling that more people from Brooklyn are moving to Kingston, or at least spending more time in their second homes here while the pandemic is going on. But hearing people chatting about this has gotten me curious to see what the size of the effect is that this trend is having on the home sales for our city. 

Realtor.com is kind enough to make their real estate transactions data available at [https://www.realtor.com/research/data/](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/)
I've started to pull out and organize some of Kingston's information to see how this year's trends are comparing to previous years'.

The documentation at https://www.realtor.com/research/data/ says that the data is updated at the beginning of the month with the previous months data. So this should be an accurate snapshot of what has happened through July.
