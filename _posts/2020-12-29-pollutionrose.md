categories: [R]

The **openair** R package, by Carslaw and Ropkins, provides a simple way to create a pollution rose from air quality and weather data (1). We're going to look at what this function of the package can do, and the mechanics of how to best take advantage of it.

##openair

**openair** is an R package created by David Carslaw and Karl Ropkins that seeks to provide tools for analysis of air pollution data. Developed in the UK, it is now used widely throughout the world for the importing, trend analysis and visualization of air quality data. **openair** is an open source package under the GLP >=2 license, and the developers chose to create their tools with R, and open source language, in order to promote reproducability, transparency, and shared methodologies in the atmospheric sciences (1).
