title:  Kingston Home Sales September Update
categories: []
---

In the previous post on [Kingston NY's home sales data](https://oroconnor.github.io/td/kingston-homes/), which looked at data through July of 2020, it was clear that  the "median home price" was up and the "days on market" was down, after a sluggish period during the pandemic shut down. What wasn't obvious was whether this was a correction after the shut down, or part of a stronger trend as many have suggested. 

Now that October is here, and we can see the data in from August and September, I think that the picture is more clear: the moves are part of a stonger trend that has persisted at least into the fall. 

Below, I'm running very similar code to before to pull [Realtor.com's data, from their "market hotness index"](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/) and create a few visualizations showing this year's activities to recent years. In the future, I'll do a deeper dive on this topic if I get inspired to do so. For now, I'd just like to show the update that I promised. I don't think that it's an over-reach to conclude that median home prices in our Zip code are, in fact, rising substantially, and that home sales are happening faster than usual.

The code that organized and visualized this data is close to identical to the previous code that I shared for the original post. If you'd like to check it out, it's in this repository: [https://github.com/oroconnor/kingstonhomesales](https://github.com/oroconnor/kingstonhomesales)
